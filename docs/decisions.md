# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Seed set carried forward from the legacy athlete-portal repo.** Each ADR below was load-bearing for MVP scope and is being re-ratified in athportal so `/epic-plan` has anchors to design against. New ADRs accumulate from ADR-016 onward as Epics close.

## ADR-001 — Query module pattern for API layer decoupling

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Inline Drizzle ORM query logic scattered across Hono route handlers creates deep coupling between HTTP concerns and database access, makes handlers hard to unit-test in isolation, and produces duplicated query fragments across routes.

**Decision**:
- Introduce a `src/queries/` directory in `@repo/api` with one file per domain (e.g. `teams.queries.ts`, `users.queries.ts`, `events.queries.ts`).
- Each query module exports typed async functions that accept a `db` instance and return typed results. **No Drizzle query-builder code lives outside these modules.**
- Route handlers import from `src/queries/` and are forbidden from constructing Drizzle queries directly.

**Consequences**:
- Query functions are individually unit-testable against an in-memory SQLite instance without spinning up a Hono server.
- New developers have a single discoverable location for all database-access patterns.
- Query reuse across routes is explicit rather than copy-pasted.

---

## ADR-002 — Centralized error handling via `withErrorHandler` middleware

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Without a central handler, every route grows its own try/catch block and error response shapes drift — some return `{ error: string }`, others `{ message: string }`, some leak raw exception messages to the client.

**Decision**:
- Introduce a `withErrorHandler(handler)` utility in `apps/api/src/lib/errors.ts` that wraps any Hono route handler in a standardized try/catch.
- All caught errors are mapped to the canonical `{ success: false, error: { code, message } }` shape defined in `@repo/shared/schemas`.
- Complement with `findOrFail(queryFn)` (throws typed 404) and `requireOwnership(record, userId)` (throws typed 403) to eliminate the most common inline guard patterns.

**Consequences**:
- Error response shape is guaranteed consistent across all routes — the contract every contract test asserts against.
- Route-handler code is leaner (the happy path only).
- `findOrFail` and `requireOwnership` are reusable across all domains without per-handler boilerplate.

---

## ADR-003 — Shared UI component library in `@repo/web`

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Ad-hoc inline implementations of common UI states (loading spinners, empty-state placeholders, user avatars) proliferate across feature components if unmanaged — identical JSX duplicated across dozens of files with inconsistent accessibility attributes and styling.

**Decision**:
- Create a `src/components/ui/` directory in `@repo/web` housing reusable primitives (`LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `EmptyState.tsx`, `Avatar.tsx`, etc.).
- Each component exports a typed props interface and follows the project accessibility baseline (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Feature components import from `@/components/ui/`. Inline re-implementations are deleted.

**Consequences**:
- Single implementation to maintain and accessibility-audit.
- Consistent visual behaviour across all surfaces.
- Props interfaces are exported, enabling consumers to extend or compose without guessing the API.

---

## ADR-004 — Test data factory pattern with typed builders

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Test files constructing raw database records inline using `{ id: 'test-1', name: 'Test User', ... }` literals are brittle (schema changes require hunting down every test), incomplete (missing required fields silently default to `undefined`), and inconsistently shaped across the suite.

**Decision**:
- Introduce a test data factory in `packages/shared/src/testing/factories/` that exports a typed builder for each major entity (`buildUser`, `buildTeam`, `buildEvent`, …).
- Each builder accepts a partial override object and merges it with safe, realistic defaults. Defaults are derived from the Zod schema to stay in sync with validation rules.
- All API and shared unit/contract tests that construct test records use these builders exclusively.

**Consequences**:
- Schema changes require updating one factory function rather than dozens of test files.
- Test intent is clearer — overrides express only the data relevant to the specific scenario.
- Factories serve as living documentation of the minimum valid shape for each entity.

---

## ADR-005 — JIT user provisioning + mandatory onboarding gate

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: New users synced from Clerk can hit authenticated API endpoints before the `user.created` webhook finishes writing the corresponding row into `users`, producing spurious 401s and empty dashboards. Inferring "needs onboarding" from sentinel values (`first_name === 'Unknown'`, `dob IS NULL`) and a dismissible client-side modal lets users close the flow without completing it.

**Decision**:
- Add a dedicated `onboarded_at` (`TEXT`, nullable, ISO 8601) column to `users` as the single source of truth for onboarding completion.
- `requireInternalUser` middleware (`apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts`) performs a **Just-In-Time** upsert: if no row exists for the verified Clerk ID, insert a placeholder row inline and continue the request. This decouples the app from Clerk webhook latency.
- Enforce onboarding server-side via Astro SSR middleware (`apps/web/src/middleware.ts`). Authenticated users whose `onboarded_at` is `NULL` are redirected to `/onboarding` with HTTP 307, except on `/onboarding` itself, `/api/*`, and asset routes.
- Replace any dismissible modal with a dedicated full-page route (`/onboarding`) that submits to `POST /api/v1/auth/onboard`. The endpoint validates the payload with `OnboardUserInputSchema` (Zod) and stamps `onboarded_at`.

**Consequences**:
- The Clerk webhook is no longer on the critical path for user creation; webhook race conditions are eliminated.
- Onboarding cannot be skipped from the client — the gate is enforced by server middleware.
- Every authenticated user is guaranteed to have either a fully-onboarded row or a placeholder row awaiting onboarding — no 404/401 "user not found" state remains.

---

## ADR-006 — Soft delete + bcrypt share passwords

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: User-visible content (highlights, comments, posts) needs full lifecycle management. Hard deletes break referential integrity for mentions, likes, and downstream analytics. Storing share passwords requires a trust model that never exposes plaintext even to operators with DB access.

**Decision**:
- Use **soft deletes** uniformly on user-visible content via a nullable `deleted_at` (ISO 8601) column. All read queries filter `deleted_at IS NULL`; cascade-deletion of child rows on parent delete is a write-time responsibility of the query module.
- Store share passwords as **bcrypt hashes** (cost factor ≥12 per the security baseline) in dedicated `*_password_hash` columns. The API hashes on write with `bcrypt.hash` and verifies on the unlock endpoint with `bcrypt.compare`. Plaintext passwords are never persisted and never echoed in responses.
- For idempotent toggle actions (likes, bookmarks), model them as join tables with unique composite indexes rather than denormalized counters on the parent row — keeps the write path idempotent and avoids lock contention.

**Consequences**:
- Recovery of accidentally deleted content is a data-layer decision rather than a customer-support escalation — any retention job can reinstate rows by clearing `deleted_at`.
- Analytics queries must explicitly filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` or they will double-count deleted rows.
- Share password rotation is a single `PATCH` — the old hash is overwritten; passing `null` clears it (public link).

---

## ADR-007 — File-upload content type validated from bytes, not headers

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: The client-supplied `Content-Type` header on a multipart part is trivially spoofed (an attacker can upload an SVG or HTML file labelled `image/png` and serve XSS to every viewer). A malformed image of the wrong dimensions also degrades the surface that renders it.

**Decision**:
- Upload endpoints **ignore the multipart `Content-Type` header entirely.** The handler reads the file bytes, sniffs the magic-number signature, and accepts only the explicitly-allowed MIME types. Anything else is rejected with `error.code = INVALID_FILE_TYPE`.
- Byte-size and dimension caps are enforced server-side before the asset is persisted. Failures return `FILE_TOO_LARGE` or `IMAGE_TOO_SMALL` so the client can render a precise message.
- Only upload endpoints may write asset URL columns (`cover_photo_url`, `avatar_url`, etc.). Profile/entity `PATCH` routes strip those fields if present, removing the URL-string surface from the trust boundary.

**Consequences**:
- Spoofed-MIME XSS via any upload surface is not reachable from a normal upload.
- Client-side validation is a UX optimization only — the server is the source of truth.
- Any color/CSS values accepted from users (e.g. branding colors) are regex-validated before being injected as CSS custom properties, closing the matching style-injection vector.

---

## ADR-008 — Slug-first public discovery surface

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Discoverable entities (organizations, teams, events, tournaments) need stable, human-readable URLs for anonymous read access by search engines and share links. They cannot be addressable only by opaque UUIDs gated behind authentication.

**Decision**:
- Add `slug` (unique, kebab-case, generated by a shared `slugify` util in `@repo/shared`) and `isPublic` (boolean, default `false`) columns to every publicly-discoverable entity.
- Introduce a `publicRead` middleware in `apps/api` that opens specific GET routes to anonymous callers and applies an **IP-keyed token-bucket rate limit** (separate from the authenticated quota).
- Public detail pages resolve by slug first, falling back to ID for back-compat. Slug routes are canonical; ID routes 301-redirect to the slug variant when a slug is present.
- Private entities (`isPublic = false`) are filtered at the **query layer**, not the response layer, so they never appear in any anonymous list response or sitemap.
- Slug uniqueness is enforced at the DB level; the slugify util appends a numeric suffix on collision so authors are not blocked at write time.

**Consequences**:
- Search engines can index public pages; structured-data and OG/Twitter card emitters standardize the per-page head.
- Anonymous abuse surface is bounded by the IP rate limiter — exceeding the bucket returns `429` with `RATE_LIMITED`.

## ADR-009 — Adopt BDD/Gherkin acceptance layer + three-tier testing pyramid

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Without a canonical document telling authors where a given assertion belongs, "where do I put this test?" consumes review cycles and produces flaky, overlapping coverage. The submodule-tracked `.agents/rules/testing-standards.md` defines a three-tier pyramid (unit, contract, acceptance) and a bidirectional placement rule; the project needs a project-level companion that maps those generic rules onto concrete tools and workspaces.

**Decision**:
- Adopt a three-tier pyramid — **unit** (Vitest, pure logic, colocated), **contract** (Vitest + ephemeral SQLite, `*.contract.test.ts`, wire shape + DB side-effects), **acceptance** (Playwright-bdd with `.feature` files; Detox binder at v1.0) — as the canonical testing model.
- Codify the **assertion-placement rule**: HTTP status codes, wire shapes, error envelopes, and DB-state assertions live **only** at the contract tier. User-visible outcomes live **only** at the acceptance tier. Pure logic lives **only** at the unit tier. Duplicated assertions across tiers are review blockers.
- Publish [`docs/testing-strategy.md`](./testing-strategy.md) as the project-level single source of truth and point `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/patterns.md` at it rather than duplicating rules.
- Reserve `.spec.ts` exclusively for Playwright acceptance specs; Vitest suites use `.test.ts` / `.test.tsx`.
- Provide a shared contract-test harness in `@repo/shared/src/testing/` (`freshDb()` / `createTestApp()` / `seedUser()`) so contract tests never hand-roll DB bootstraps.

**Consequences**:
- Authors pick a tier deterministically by the class of assertion — review cycles stop re-litigating placement.
- RBAC correctness is covered exhaustively at the unit tier (every `(role, resource, action)` triple) and re-enforced at the contract tier on real routes.

## ADR-010 — Detox is the mobile acceptance runner (v1.0)

**Status**: Accepted (forward-looking; activates with the v1.0 native-apps Epic)

**Context**: When mobile native apps ship at v1.0, the BDD acceptance runner must bind the shared `tests/features/**` Gherkin corpus to a mobile step library so cross-platform scenarios execute on iOS and Android without duplicating authoring. The two candidates evaluated in the legacy project were Detox and Maestro.

**Decision**:
- **Adopt Detox** as the mobile acceptance runner. Bindings live at `apps/mobile/e2e/steps/**`; the binder that converts `tests/features/**` into Jest+Detox tests lives at `apps/mobile/e2e/bind-features.mjs`.
- **Mirror the web runner's step-library organization** in Detox (`auth.steps.ts`, `navigation.steps.ts`, `form.steps.ts`, `visibility.steps.ts`, `rbac.steps.ts`, …). New cross-platform step phrases land on both platforms in the same change.
- **Extend `scripts/lint-steps.mjs`** to cover both `apps/web/e2e/steps/**` and `apps/mobile/e2e/steps/**` with the same forbidden-pattern list — one linter, one vocabulary contract.
- **Cross-runner parity** is enforced by `scripts/check-step-parity.mjs`: a cross-platform scenario phrase bound on only one side fails the build.
- **Maestro** may be retained for single-flow mobile smoke checks that don't need step-library parity, but does not execute any `.feature` scenario.

**Rejected — Maestro as primary runner**: Maestro flows are YAML, not TypeScript; there is no analogue to a step-definition file. Adding a new cross-platform phrase requires editing an adapter script rather than a `.steps.ts` file beside its web twin, and the forbidden-pattern linter cannot be applied to YAML without parallel maintenance.

**Consequences**:
- Step-library and linter parity is structural, not aspirational.
- Tag-filtered project matrix (`smoke` / `risk-high` / `nightly` / `default`) carries over from web to mobile unchanged.
- A Cucumber-compatible report from Detox+Jest keeps downstream report ingestion (`/sprint-testing`) working without a new format.

## ADR-011 — Supply-chain CVE gate is a required check

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: The security baseline requires `pnpm audit` to run before every release. Without a required CI gate, that rule is unenforced — a reachable High/Critical advisory can land on `main` silently.

**Decision**:
- **Promote a `supply-chain-security` job to a required check** on `main`. `build-and-e2e` (and any mobile equivalents) list it in `needs:` so a failed audit blocks the deploy-targeted pipeline.
- **Block on High and Critical advisories.** A `scripts/audit-check.mjs --level=high --prod` script exits non-zero on any unsuppressed High/Critical advisory in the production graph. Moderate findings surface in the JSON artifact for review but do not block.
- **`pnpm.overrides` is the primary remediation lever.** When a transitive CVE has a patched upstream version, the fix lands as an `overrides` entry in `package.json` — not as a silenced advisory.
- **Allow-list exceptions require a written reason and revisit date.** The `IGNORED` map in `scripts/audit-check.mjs` is the suppression mechanism for the rare advisory with no upstream patch and a documented unreachability argument. Each entry carries a `reason` string and a `revisit` date.
- **Upload `audit.json` as a 14-day artifact** so reviewers can triage Moderate findings without re-running the audit locally.

**Consequences**:
- `main` cannot ship a new reachable High/Critical advisory without an explicit suppression.
- Override entries become a hygiene artifact — each pinning a security floor has a paired audit-finding ID.

---

## ADR-012 — Observability vendor stack (MVP beta)

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: The MVP beta needs the minimum viable production stack to leave a black-box state: error tracking across runtimes, structured logs with edge-side PII redaction, latency/error dashboards on top-N routes, external uptime probes, and an alert path that reaches the operator.

**Decision**:
- **Sentry** is the error-tracking vendor across `apps/api`, `apps/web`, and (at v1.0) `apps/mobile`. First-party SDKs cover all runtimes (`@sentry/cloudflare`, `@sentry/astro` + `@sentry/react`, later `@sentry/react-native`). Sourcemap upload wired into CI per runtime.
- **Cloudflare Workers Analytics Engine + Logpush** is the structured-log + dashboard surface for `apps/api`. The AE binding (`LOG_AE`) lands one row per request from the request-completion logger middleware; Logpush forwards full structured payloads to a managed sink for retention and search.
- **Better Stack** is the external uptime-probe vendor. Probes MUST be hosted by a vendor independent of Cloudflare so a Cloudflare-side outage cannot silence its own alerts.
- **The alerting channel of record is the operator's email**, paged by Sentry alert rules and Better Stack failure rules into the same inbox. No parallel paging path (SMS, Pushover, PagerDuty) is provisioned for the beta.
- **Cost ceiling: $50/month.** Beta posture lands on free tiers; ceiling is set well above the estimate so a single-month overage doesn't require same-day escalation. Two consecutive months over triggers a renegotiate/downsize follow-on.
- **Migration cost is bounded at one Story per vendor.** No vendor lock-in beyond the SDK surface.

**Rejected — Datadog / Honeycomb unified vendor**: Free tiers too small for a unified observability vendor at beta scale; SDK surface area would be a multi-Story rewrite to swap later.

**Rejected — Cloudflare tail logs only**: Tail logs do not symbolicate stack traces against uploaded sourcemaps; do not cover web SSR errors or mobile JS crashes.

**Consequences**:
- The redaction allowlist at `packages/shared/src/observability/redaction.ts` is the single trust boundary for log egress.
- A synthetic-failure endpoint (gated by env flag) is the operator's validated end-to-end alert path.

---

## ADR-013 — Staging-auto, production-gated deploy promotion

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: The production deploy pipeline needs (a) staging deploys with no approval friction so every push to `main` rolls forward immediately, (b) production deploys behind a manual-approval gate that cannot be bypassed by accidentally tagging a release or merging a hot-fix, (c) per-environment secret scoping, and (d) a documented rollback procedure with an audit trail.

**Decision**:
- **Two workflows, two environments, two triggers.** `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` is triggered on `push` to `main` and binds every job to `environment: staging`. `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` is triggered on `workflow_dispatch` only — no `push` or `schedule` trigger — and binds every job to `environment: production`.
- **GitHub Environments are the safety boundary.** Secrets, approvers, and deploy targets live in the Environment, not on the repo. The production Environment carries a Required-reviewers protection rule with at least one named approver. Nothing in the workflow YAML can bypass it.
- **`scripts/check-env.mjs --deploy --env <name>`** is the per-environment fail-fast. Each deploy workflow runs this as a `validate-*-config` job that every deploy job depends on.
- **Rollback procedure** has two supported paths: (1) re-dispatch `Deploy · Production` with `ref: <previous tag or SHA>` (preferred — full audit trail in GitHub Actions log); (2) `wrangler rollback --env production` (faster, but audit lives only in Cloudflare's deployment history — the runbook records the rationale separately).
- **Audit-trail expectations.** Every production deploy MUST be traceable to (a) workflow run ID, (b) approver's GitHub identity, (c) deployed git ref, (d) Sentry release tag emitted at build time.

**Rejected — single multi-stage pipeline** (`push → staging → wait → production`): Secret blast radius (easy to reference a production secret in a staging step); rollback ergonomics (re-dispatching re-runs both stages); partial-success handling (staging-success / production-denied reports as overall "failed").

**Rejected — push-triggered production with branch protection**: This repo doesn't use PRs; branch-protection-based reviewers don't apply.

**Consequences**:
- A leaked staging credential cannot reach production.
- Production rollback is operator-driven via the production workflow; staging is untouched.

---

## ADR-014 — Bundle-size budget revision procedure

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Bundle-size baselines live in `baselines/bundle-size.json` and `.size-limit.json`. Without an ADR, the lowest-friction reaction to a failing build is to bump the budget — that path defeats the gate and silently raises the regression bar over time. Cloudflare Workers also impose a hard 1 MiB compressed upload cap; raising that is not negotiable.

**Decision**:
- **An overrun is a regression to fix by default.** When `pnpm bundle-size:check` fails, the first remediation is to land the change without the size delta (strip a dependency, lazy-load the surface, split into a route off the critical path). Bumping the budget is the **last** lever, not the first.
- **Raising a budget requires a paired `rationale` update in the same change**, naming the dependency or feature that justifies the headroom. Bumps exceeding +25% of the previous limit additionally name the alternative considered and why it was rejected.
- **The Cloudflare 1 MiB compressed Worker cap is non-negotiable.** The script warns at 90% of cap and fails at 100% regardless of per-bundle budget. Approaching the cap triggers a planning Story for a Worker split, not a budget bump.
- **The +10% headroom on initial commit is a one-time grace, not a recurring allowance.** Subsequent revisions are measured against the *previous committed budget*, not the current measurement.
- **Intentional dependency upgrades are budget-bump candidates; accidental regressions are not.**

**Rejected — advisory-only gate**: Audit cost dominates the gate cost; the operator has zero spare attention for quarterly slogs.

**Rejected — auto-bump on first overrun**: Directly subverts the gate's intent — converts it into an audit log no one reads.

**Consequences**:
- The `rationale` field becomes the per-bundle changelog.
- Approaching the 1 MiB cap is a planning trigger, not a budget edit.

---

## ADR-015 — Per-package coverage hard floor with absolute-pp tolerance

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Coverage % without a per-package ratchet lets a package decay from 88% to 30% silently while passing every other gate. The seven-baseline quality-ratchet model requires a dedicated coverage floor alongside lint, CRAP, maintainability, mutation, lighthouse, and bundle-size.

**Decision**:
- Adopt a per-workspace coverage baseline at `baselines/coverage.json` gated by `scripts/coverage-baseline.mjs`.
- **Floor per workspace = `current − 2 percentage points`** (absolute, not relative). The check runs in the `test` and `test-mobile` jobs immediately after coverage capture.
- Refresh procedure: run `pnpm test:coverage` → `pnpm coverage:update` (overwrites the baseline file with current values + `generatedAt` timestamp + tolerance metadata) → commit with subject `chore(baseline): refresh coverage baseline (-2pp buffer)`.
- **Never raise a floor without a corresponding test addition.** Refreshing upward should reflect real coverage gain, not noise. If uncertain, run `pnpm test:coverage` twice and take the lower numbers.

**Rejected — relative-% tolerance to match CRAP**: 5% relative would be 4pp at 80% baseline, 4.75pp at 95% baseline. Penalizes high-coverage packages disproportionately, gives low-coverage packages too much rope.

**Rejected — per-metric tolerances (lines vs branches vs functions vs statements)**: Premature complexity. The JSON shape supports it later without breaking the file format.

**Consequences**:
- Coverage drift is visible at CI time, not at quarterly audit.
- The check is per-workspace, not aggregate — a 5pp drop in `@repo/mobile` cannot be hidden by a 5pp gain in `@repo/api`.
- The initial commit ships unprimed (`primed: false`, `null` per-workspace entries). The operator runs `pnpm test:coverage && pnpm coverage:update` once to prime real numbers.

---

## ADR-016 — `/api/v1` route-mount and post-MVP deprecation policy

**Status**: Accepted (2026-05-17, Epic #3)

**Context**: The HTTP API surface needs a single, stable mount point so clients (web, mobile-web PWA, later native mobile) can pin to a versioned base URL without re-discovering route shape on every release. Pre-MVP, the API is still finding its shape — every Epic that lands routes may legitimately need to rename a path, restructure a payload, or remove a field that turned out to be wrong. Post-MVP, the same flexibility is a stability liability: a paying client cannot tolerate a silent breaking change to `GET /api/v1/teams/:id`. The project also needs an explicit answer to "what happens when we *do* need to break a v1 contract after MVP launch?" so the question doesn't get re-litigated per Epic.

**Decision**:
- **All API routes mount under `/api/v1`.** Every router under `apps/api/src/routes/v1/**` composes onto this prefix; no route ships at `/api/<anything-else>` or at the bare `/` path (excepting the health probe `/api/v1/health` and any Cloudflare-required well-known endpoints). The `v1` segment is a literal, not a build-time variable — clients pin to it directly.
- **Pre-MVP, breaking changes inside `/api/v1` are allowed.** Until MVP launch the API has no external paying clients; the cost of a renamed path or restructured payload is bounded to the same-PR client update. Document the breakage in the Epic's PR body and update the matching Zod schema in `@repo/shared` in the same change — `architecture.md` § 5 (Safety Constraints) already requires this pairing.
- **Post-MVP, `/api/v1` is additive-only.** Once MVP ships, `/api/v1` accepts only backwards-compatible changes: new routes, new optional request fields, new response fields. Removing a field, renaming a path, tightening a validator, or changing a status-code semantic is **not** an additive change and **must not** land on `/api/v1`.
- **Breaking changes ship to `/api/v2` with a six-month deprecation overlap.** When a breaking change is genuinely required post-MVP, it lands behind a new `/api/v2` mount. The previous version (`/api/v1`) continues to serve for **six months** from the day `/api/v2` ships its first route in the affected domain. During the overlap, both versions are maintained; after the overlap, the deprecated route on `/api/v1` returns `410 Gone` with an error envelope pointing clients at the `/api/v2` replacement.
- **The six-month clock runs per route, not per version.** Adding a single breaking route under `/api/v2` does not start a deprecation clock on the entire `/api/v1` surface — only on the matching route. Routes that never had a breaking change continue indefinitely under `/api/v1`.

**Rejected — unversioned mount (`/api/*`)**: Forces every breaking change to be either a coordinated client rollout or a silent failure for older clients. No safety margin for slow mobile rollouts.

**Rejected — date-versioned mount (`/api/2026-05`)**: Solves the per-change versioning problem but explodes the URL surface and complicates RPC-client typing against `@repo/api`'s `AppType`. Acceptable for some industries (Stripe) but disproportionate for an athlete-portal scope.

**Rejected — header-based versioning (`Accept: application/vnd.athportal.v2+json`)**: Hides the version from caches, CDN routing rules, log dashboards, and operator-readable URLs. Worse ergonomics for the same correctness guarantees as path-versioned mounts.

**Consequences**:
- The `apps/api/src/routes/v1/**` directory shape is a load-bearing convention — moving a router out of that tree is a breaking change subject to this ADR.
- Foundation Epics that touch the API entrypoint (router composition, OpenAPI emission, Hono RPC client typing) reference this ADR rather than re-deciding the prefix.
- Post-MVP, every Epic that lands routes has a checklist item: "is this additive? if not, does it belong under `/api/v2`?". The answer lives in the Epic PR body.
- The six-month overlap is a **floor**, not a ceiling. Specific routes may be carried longer when client telemetry shows non-trivial residual traffic; shortening below six months requires an ADR superseding this one.
- Cross-references: `docs/architecture.md` § 1 (Tech Stack) names the `/api/v1` mount as the API workspace's entrypoint; this ADR is the authoritative rule it points back to.

## 2026-05-17 — `quality` workflow is the canonical PR quality gate

**Status**: Accepted (operational pin, Epic #3)

**Context**: Epic #2 landed the [`quality`](../.github/workflows/quality.yml)
workflow (lint → typecheck → test → build → lint-baseline ratchet) and
wired it into `pull_request` and `push: main`. Epic #3 needs a single
named PR gate to declare "required" on the `main` branch ruleset so the
[branch-protection-setup runbook](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md)
has an unambiguous target. Without an explicit pin, future Epics could
introduce parallel quality workflows and the "which checks are
required?" question becomes a recurring review topic.

**Decision**:
- **The `quality` workflow is the canonical PR quality gate.** It is the
  required check listed in
  [`docs/runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md`](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md)
  under "Required status checks" for the `main` branch.
- New language-, framework-, or domain-level quality steps land **inside**
  `quality.yml` (as additional steps in the existing job, or as new jobs
  in the same workflow) rather than as parallel workflows. The required
  check name stays `quality` for the lifetime of the project.
- Workflows that are **not** the PR quality gate
  (`migration-label-guard`, `deploy-staging`, `deploy-production`,
  future security/governance hooks) live in their own files and are
  added to the branch-protection rule on their own merits — they do not
  subsume `quality`'s role.
- `pnpm run quality:ci-local` MUST remain a faithful local mirror of
  `quality.yml`'s job chain so contributors can reproduce CI failures
  offline without a push.

**Consequences**:
- The branch-protection ruleset has a stable, named target —
  re-applying it after a fork is mechanical.
- The "which workflow gates the PR?" question has a single answer at any
  point in time, which is what the runbook documents.
- Adding a quality step is a single-file change (`quality.yml`) plus, if
  the step introduces a new failure mode, a paragraph in
  [`docs/patterns.md`](./patterns.md). It is **not** a new required
  check on the ruleset.

## ADR-017 — Destructive-migration label, guard workflow, and two-reviewer rule

**Status**: Accepted (2026-05-17, Epic #3)

**Context**: Schema migrations are the highest-risk class of change in
this repo because they cannot be rolled back by
[`wrangler rollback`](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md) once the
database has applied them. A `DROP COLUMN`, a `RENAME`, or a
`NOT NULL ADD` against a populated column is a one-way door — a forward
fix requires a fresh migration that re-creates state, which under time
pressure during an incident is the exact wrong shape of work. The same
PR-level gate that catches code regressions (the `quality` workflow)
cannot detect this risk class because it operates on lint/type/test
output, not on a semantic read of the diff. Without an explicit label
and a workflow that requires it, the destructive change ships when the
first reviewer is moving fast and the diff happens to be small.

**Decision**:
- **The `migration::destructive` PR label is the canonical marker for
  destructive schema changes.** Any PR whose diff adds a `DROP`,
  `RENAME`, or `NOT NULL ADD` clause inside a Drizzle migration file
  under `apps/api/**/migrations/**` MUST carry the label. The label is
  created once via the
  [branch-protection setup runbook](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md#one-time-label-bootstrap)
  with color `D93F0B` and the description
  `"PR touches a destructive migration (DROP / RENAME / NOT NULL ADD) — second-approver required"`.
- **The `migration-label-guard` workflow enforces the label
  mechanically.** It runs on `pull_request` (opened, synchronize,
  reopened, labeled, unlabeled), reads the PR diff via the GitHub API,
  matches added lines against the three destructive patterns above
  inside the migration path predicate, and fails the check when matches
  are found without the label. When no migration files are touched the
  check passes trivially — this is required because the
  `apps/api/**/migrations/**` directory does not yet exist on every
  branch.
- **The two-reviewer rule is enforced procedurally.** GitHub
  branch-protection's required-approvers count cannot conditionally bump
  for a single label, so the rule is documented in
  [`README.md` § "Destructive migrations"](../README.md#destructive-migrations)
  and lives in the reviewer's discipline: the first reviewer approves on
  general merit and explicitly `@`-mentions a second reviewer; the
  second reviewer's approval is what unlocks the merge. The PR author
  MUST NOT self-merge a `migration::destructive` PR.
- **The label and the guard are paired, not redundant.** The guard
  fails-closed when the label is missing — that is the load-bearing
  mechanical gate. The two-reviewer rule fails-open by design — it
  relies on reviewer attention to honor the convention. Both layers are
  needed: the guard catches "author forgot to label"; the two-reviewer
  rule catches "author labeled correctly but the change still needs
  more eyes".

**Rejected — branch-protection rule with conditional required-approvers
based on label**: GitHub's branch-protection ruleset cannot express
"require 2 approvers when label X is present, 1 otherwise". The closest
analog is a CODEOWNERS escalation, which requires a `CODEOWNERS` file
keyed to migration paths — that approach trades the label visibility (a
red badge in the PR list) for a hidden CODEOWNERS mapping that authors
won't notice until they hit the rule.

**Rejected — pre-commit hook that blocks destructive clauses**: A
local hook fires before the PR exists, can be bypassed with
`--no-verify`, and is not the reviewer-visible signal the label
provides. Hooks complement the workflow at most — they do not replace
it.

**Rejected — workflow that auto-applies the label**: The label is a
declaration of intent ("I know this is destructive and the migration is
necessary"), not a side effect of the diff shape. Auto-applying the
label drops the author's accountability and removes the moment of
deliberation the label is there to create.

**Consequences**:
- The `migration::destructive` label is part of the repo's required-PR
  vocabulary; adding the workflow as a required check on the `main`
  ruleset is the operator's responsibility per the
  [branch-protection setup runbook](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md#1-required-status-checks).
- The guard workflow's path predicate (`apps/api/**/migrations/**`) is a
  load-bearing convention. Moving migrations out of that tree without
  updating the workflow defeats the gate silently.
- The guard inspects **added** lines only. A diff that removes a
  destructive clause (reverting a previous migration) does not re-fire
  the guard.
- Cross-references:
  [`README.md` § "Destructive migrations"](../README.md#destructive-migrations)
  (the author-facing rule surface) and
  [`docs/runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md`](./runbooks/branch-protection-setup.md)
  (the operator-facing setup runbook) both point back to this ADR.
  Changes to the policy require superseding this ADR, not editing the
  downstream documents in isolation.
